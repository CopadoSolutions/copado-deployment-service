# Copado deployment service - On premise

This project runs Copado On-Premise Deployment Job, which allows to run your own code validations before deploy metadata to Salesforce.



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

In order to be able to develop on this project, you will need to install:

* [Java jdk 1.8.0](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) or above

* Java development IDE

* [Maven 3.6.0](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)  or above


### Installing

Follow this steps to install to get a development environment running

* Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/CopadoSolutions/copado-deployment-service.git
```

* Import the project as Maven project to your Java development IDE.
* Build the project

```
mvn clean install
```

* Add the properties to the project, two options available:

  * As environment settings. 

  * As application.properties or application.yml

  You can find a list with all the needed properties here [application-template.properties](./src/main/resources/application-template.properties)

* Check the project runs

```
java -jar target/copado-deployment-service-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -help
```

​	After run this command, you will be able to see the project help usage in the command line.



### Service implementation

This is a Guice based project, and some service implementations can be accomplished to deeper customization. Following service interfaces must be implemented to project customization:

| Service                                                      | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| copado.onpremise.service.git.GitService                      | Git client that allows to connect and execute actions in your git repository. |
| copado.onpremise.service.credential.SalesforceCredentialService | Service that allows to retrieve the   credentials for your organizations. |
| copado.onpremise.service.validation.ValidationService        | Service that will allow or deny the deployment.              |

All of these services includes a default implementation into the given project.



## Running the tests

To run the automated tests for this system, run the following command

```
mvn verify
```



## Deployment

To deploy this project on a live system, you need to follow this steps.



### Build and package the project. 

To build and package the project, run the following command

```
mvn clean install
```

This will auto-generate a `jar` file in the `target` folder. For example, for version `1.0.0` the generated file will be:

```target/copado-deployment-service-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar ```



### Deploy

Deploy the **copado-deployment-service-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar** into your production environment and set the environment variables in your system or add the [application.properties](./src/main/resources/application-template.properties) to the jar class-path.

If you choose environment setting option, you will need to set all the settings defined on the file  [application-template.properties](./src/main/resources/application-template.properties). In order configure them, you can follow this command line example:

``` 
env "copado.onpremise.deployment.copadoUsername=YOUR_COPADO_USERNAME" bash
```



## Run

To run the project use the following command

``` copado-deployment-service-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -deployBranchName DEPLOY_BRANCH_NAME```



### Expected input

In the given `DEPLOY_BRANCH_NAME` the service will search for the following structure

```
/deployment
│
└── payload.json
└── SOME_FILE.zip
```



Where **payload.json** has the following structure [DeployRequest.java](./src/main/java/copado/onpremise/job/DeployRequest.java)

```
{
  "deploymentJobId": "SALESFORCE_DEPLOYMENT_JOB_ID",
  "promoteBranch": "GIT_PROMOTE_BRANCH_NAME",
  "targetBranch": "GIT_ENVIROMENT_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME",
  "copadoJobId": "COPADO_JOB_ID_FOR_LOGs",
  "orgDestId": "SALESFORCE_DESTINATION_ORG_ID",
  "testLevel": "NoTestRun",
  "testClasses": [
    "My_CustomTestClass_One",
    "My_CustomTestClass_Two"
  ],
  "isCheckOnly": true,
  "gitAuthor": "GIT_AUTHOR",
  "gitAuthorEmail": "GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL",
  "artifactRepositoryIds": [
    "Artifact_Repository_Id_One",
    "Artifact_Repository_Id_Two"
  ]
}
```

* **deploymentJobId**: Salesforce record id for the associated deployment job.
* **promoteBranch**: must exists in the repository, is the promotion branch which will be validate against the deploy.zip
* **targetBranch**: target branch which represent the target environment on the deployment.
* **copadoJobId**: identifier auto-generated by Copado 
* **orgDestId**: Salesforce Organization id for the destination environment.
* **testLevel**: Salesforce test level to do the deployment.
* **testClasses**: Salesforce test classes (optional), just needed when testLevel is RunSpecifiedTests.
* **isCheckOnly**: Salesforce check only to do the deployment.
* **gitAuthor:** Author that will commit into the git repositories.
* **gitAuthorEmail:** Email that will commit into the git repositories.
* **artifactRepositoryIds:** Salesforce Id for artifact git repositories.



The **SOME_FILE.zip** is the zip file generated by Copado which will be deployed.



## Built With

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
