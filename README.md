```

​	After run this command, you will be able to see the project help usage in the command line.



### Service implementation

This is a Guice based project, and some service implementations can be accomplished to deeper customization. Following service interfaces must be implemented to project customization:

| Service                                                      | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| copado.onpremise.service.git.GitService                      | Git client that allows to connect and execute actions in your git repository. |
| copado.onpremise.service.credential.SalesforceCredentialService | Service that allows to retrieve the   credentials for your organizations. |
| copado.onpremise.service.validation.ValidationService        | Service that will allow or deny the deployment.              |

All of these services includes a default implementation into the given project.



## Running the tests

To run the automated tests for this system, run the following command

```
mvn verify
```



## Deployment

To deploy this project on a live system, you need to follow this steps.



### Build and package the project. 

To build and package the project, run the following command

```
mvn clean install
```

This will auto-generate a `jar` file in the `target` folder. For example, for version `1.0.0` the generated file will be:

```target/copado-deployment-service-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar ```



### Deploy

Deploy the **copado-deployment-service-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar** into your production environment and set the environment variables in your system or add the [application.properties](./src/main/resources/application-template.properties) to the jar class-path.

If you choose environment setting option, you will need to set following ones:

``` 
env "copado.onpremise.deployment.copadoUsername=YOUR_COPADO_USERNAME" bash
env "copado.onpremise.deployment.copadoUrl=YOUR_COPADO_BASE_URL/services/Soap/u/43.0" bash
env "copado.onpremise.deployment.copadoPassword=YOUR_COPADO_PASSWORD" bash
env "copado.onpremise.deployment.copadoToken=YOUR_COPADO_TOKEN" bash

# (Optional - Just for default implementation)
# (GitService)
env "copado.onpremise.deployment.gitUrl=YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL.git" bash
env "copado.onpremise.deployment.gitUsername=YOUR_GIT_USERNAME" bash
env "copado.onpremise.deployment.gitPassword=YOUR_GIT_TOKEN" bash
# (SalesforceCredentialService)
env "copado.onpremise.deployment.YOUR_ORG_ID.url=YOUR_ORG_BASE_URL/services/Soap/u/43.0" bash
env "copado.onpremise.deployment.YOUR_ORG_ID.username=YOUR_ORG_USER" bash
env "copado.onpremise.deployment.YOUR_ORG_ID.token=YOUR_ORG_TOKEN" bash
env "copado.onpremise.deployment.YOUR_ORG_ID.password=YOUR_ORG_PASSWORD" bash
```



## Run

To run the project use the following command

``` copado-deployment-service-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -deployBranchName DEPLOY_BRANCH_NAME```



### Expected input

In the given `DEPLOY_BRANCH_NAME` the service will search for the following structure

```
/deployment
│
└── payload.json
└── SOME_FILE.zip
```



Where **payload.json** has the following structure

```
{
  "deploymentJobId":"SALESFORCE_DEPLOYMENT_JOB_ID",
  "promoteBranch":"GIT_PROMOTE_BRANCH_NAME",
  "targetBranch":"GIT_ENVIROMENT_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME",
  "copadoJobId":"COPADO_JOB_ID_FOR_LOGs",
  "orgDestId":"SALESFORCE_DESTINATION_ORG_ID"
}
```

* **deploymentJobId**: Salesforce record id for the associated deployment job.
* **promoteBranch**: must exists in the repository, is the promotion branch which will be validate against the deploy.zip
* **targetBranch**: target branch which represent the target environment on the deployment.
* **copadoJobId**: identifier auto-generated by Copado 
* **orgDestId**: Salesforce Organization id for the destination environment.



The **SOME_FILE.zip** is the zip file generated by Copado which will be deployed.



## Built With

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
